Collapsible and expandable menu with contents


Main challenges:

(1) this was an easy project with only one twist - how to trigger a new event with each click

(2) Remember to use a counter that allows to assign a count to the number of clicks and with each click you can use if statement to trigger an event. If you need events repeated like so:

- first click - blue color

-second click - red color

- third click - yellow color


Run a for loop and increase and decrease value of the counter to get the desired affect.
